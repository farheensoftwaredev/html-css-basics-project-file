<p  class="superp">CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
     including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
     provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation</P>



<p class="superp">content of css</h2>Separation of formatting and content also
    makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
    styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
    in print, by voice and on Braille-based tactile devices.
    CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. </p>
